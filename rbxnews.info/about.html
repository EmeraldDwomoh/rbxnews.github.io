      RBXnews is a news website that lets you see Roblox news. We are not Roblox or RBX News on X. In order for
      people to have the best experience, we decited to not put ads on our website. This website was
       established in July 4th, 2024 by Emerald Dwomoh and was in development a day before that. 
      This website is in beta meaning we're still working on it. Please do not sue us for copyright
      infringment. After ideas for websites, I came up with this. I am the creator of the website,
      and this is all done by coding this website. I decited to code this website when there is
      websites that lets you build a websites which I didn't like and I was like, "how these
      websites were created?". For donations, Please deliver the money to 18594 W Minnezona Ave.
      Goodyear AZ, 85395. We are not accepting credit card payments at this time.
