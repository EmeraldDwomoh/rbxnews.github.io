    <p class="default_font"> A lot of people were complaining "Why isn't this nominated, why is this nominated?" etc.,
      etc. There is people claiming that Souls RNG is rigging the vote. Souls RNG that if they won the award that they are
      nominated for, every single player in Souls RNG would get like special things wich is not too crazy. This has been a thing
      that's heen going on forever on Roblox. Every time Roblox host a bloxy award or innovation award, most of the
      developers that got nominated would always give out free stuff if they won which is not anything new. A lot of people
      don't like Souls RNG.
